					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<h2>The one bag team</h2>
					<p>
						Startet with a person with a vision. Now we are a team of 8
						designers, 4 carvers, and 12 seamstresses who work full time.
					</p>
					<h2>Making The One bag</h2>
					<p>
						The one bag is either functional or stylish, so that there is
						something for every need.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each functional bag is carefully designed so that they can be used
						for everyday challenges. This implies that it takes about 8 hours to
						design a bag, so just above a full days work for one of our
						designers. Other than that a carver uses 3 hours to make the
						materials ready for every bag, which our seamstress then assemble to
						your bag in 14 hours.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every stylish bag has the same amount of finess and detail. For one
						of these bags, one of our designers use 12 hours for designing, and
						then one of our carvers cut out the parts for the bag in 7 hours.
						Lastly it is assembled by one of our seamstresses in 6 hours.
