						We have shops in both Denmark and Germany where we sell our grass.
						In Germany we sell at least 18'000m<sup>2 </sup>
						grass per month, and at least 10'000m<sup>2 </sup>
						grass per month in Denmark.
					</p>
					<p>
						In Denmark we sell twice as much luxury grass than basic grass, and
						in Germany, we sell equal amounts of luxury and basic grass. The
						price for transporting 1m
						<sup>2 </sup>
						of Basic grass is 3kr. and 7kr. for luxury.
