						We have shops in both Denmark and Germany where we sell our grass.
						In Germany we sell at least 18'000m<sup>2 </sup>
						basic grass per month, and at least 5'000m<sup>2 </sup>
						luxury grass per month.
					</p>
					<p>
						In Denmark we sell twice as much luxury grass as in Germany, but
						they buy equal amounts of Basic grass. The price for transporting 1m
						<sup>2 </sup>
						of grass to Germany is 3kr. and 4kr. to Denmark.
